1. Agile Workflow
AI 
1. Image Recognition 
2. recommenders System
3. Data Collection
Image Recognition 
1. Paid API's 
   1. (Google cloudvision/ Amazon’s Rekognition API /Nyckel)
   2. paid, need enhancement and tweaking according to our requirement 
2. Free API 
   1. APIs-https://europeangaming.eu/portal/latest-news/2019/04/12/43299/top-5-open-source-ai-solutions-for-image-processing/
   2. OpencV, Tensor Flow , Google Colab
   3. Few pre-trained and to be trained.
      1. Collect data (images and label them)
      2. Training Model
      3. Freezing & Conversion
      4. Deploy
      5. Tuning based on Android/ IOS / web 
   4. The only perquisite is that you know how to program in Python though you can also learn how to do so using the many examples you will find in OpenCV.
   5. Fruit and vegetable - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF6rMXZcuCs
   6. Text Detection + Image recognition
3. Building our own from scratch based on requirement.
   1. However, building a custom machine learning model or neural network requires lots of resources and a high level of technology expertise. 
4. ML platform  (storage /Azure Data Lake/ AData Factory)
   1. To store, process, clean shared space -perhaps not immediate .

Opencv






If it is for an app
* Use Google ML Kit. It works on both iOS and Android. Even the web actually, and you can benefit from the cloud offload too.
* On iOS, you have Core ML which has base machine learning models available too.
* Otherwise, OpenCV is a library available also in numerous programming languages and operating systems
